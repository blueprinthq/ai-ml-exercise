Speaker #1

Good afternoon. My name is doctor Snow White, and I am a pre licensed counselor. And what does that mean? It means that I have to be supervised for the type of work that I do. The first supervisor that I have, his name is doctor Peter Pan, and he is a licensed psychologist here in our state. And I also have a secondary supervisor. Her name is doctor Cinderella, and she's also a licensed psychologist here in the state of Alabama. Before we can So one of the things that I'd like to discuss with you is your patient rights, and you are protected both by federal and state laws. One of your patient rights is that I'm not allowed to share any sort of information that could identify you. So the information that you have here cannot be shared with anybody else. K? So I do have to keep that confidential and secret for you. If you're under and above, I should say, the age of fourteen, I would need your written consent. So for instance, if you wanted me to talk to your psychiatrist or your employer or somebody like that, I will need expressed written permission in order for me to break confidentiality. There are some limits to that, though. So for example, if you pose to be a liable and viable threat to yourself, meaning that you will kill yourself or that you will kill another person, you and I are going to work together to deescalate that situation. If I am unable to reduce the chances that that can occur, then that is an instance that I would have to break confidentiality and get in people that can help us keep you safe. There's another limit to that confidentiality, of course, and that is if there is a child or an elderly individual or a vulnerable person that is at risk of sexual or physical assault in our particular state, that would be anybody under the age of nineteen or any person above the age of sixty four, and that is something that I cannot keep confidential. Do you have any questions for me about anything I just mentioned? No. Alright. So today, we are going to talk about your initial assessment. So what is our objective today? My objective here is to get to know you. Right? To get to know things like your background, family history, things about maybe some issues that you may be having, maybe some stuff about your school or your work. So, basically, I'm trying to get to know you. The better that I get to know you, the easier it's going to be for us later on in treatment so that I can help you. So are you going to find that I'm going to ask you a lot of questions? They're very similar to the form that you filled out before we started. It's basically a lot of information about symptoms, your background, your strengths, your goals that you have here in therapy. So I don't want you to think that there is a right answer or correct answer. There isn't a correct answer. To me, the best answer is an honest answer. K? Like I said, I can share this information with anybody else. So do you have any questions? Okay. So like I said, it's really short questions. You don't have to elaborate in any of the questions. So just use the best answer that you have for that question. Okay? So let's start with the very basic information. If I were to ask you to tell me in one sentence what brings you here today, what would you tell me?

0:03:41

Speaker #2

My husband is an alcoholic, and I have been depressed trying to keep our relationship together. Okay. I'm very sorry.

0:03:49

Speaker #3

Relationship together. Okay. I'm very sorry to hear that.

0:03:52

Speaker #1

That's really challenging for you right now. But I am happy to help you with that if that's your goal here in session. Okay? So in upcoming sessions, we'll be more than glad to help you. And I'm happy to take your visit today. So why? Tell me what kind of things have you noticed in your relationship right now? Tell me about how long has this been occurring. Tell me about say, for example, when did it start? What can you tell me?

0:04:20

Speaker #2

Well, we've been together for six years, and he has drank that entire time. Okay. I feel like it has gotten more in the past six months, it's gotten worse. He's been drinking more, and he's become a lot more verbally and even sometimes physically abusive.

0:04:43

Speaker #1

Okay. What can you tell me about this abuse? And it's okay if you can't answer a question right now if you're not ready for that. Okay?

0:04:53

Speaker #2

The verbal abuse is like, oh, well, he he sometimes accuses me of, like, cheating on him if I'm five minutes late from work. Like, oh, you must have been with another man. Who would want you? You're ugly. You're lazy. The physical abuse is when he comes home drunk, and, he starts in on me, and I'm like, you know, stop. I'm not cheating on you or whatever. And the mode he hasn't hit me in the face, so I guess it's not really physical abuse. But he pushed me up against the wall one day and and helped me up against the wall. Okay. How would you describe physical abuse to me? I guess, just, like, if he hit me.

0:05:40

Speaker #1

Okay. Okay. What is hitting to you? What would that be? So for example, a punch, a slap. I should say a hit. I would say a slap or a punch would be. Okay. I understand. Do you consider your leg to be injured? No. Do you guys have any pending separation? Have you guys separated before? How long have you guys been married? Never. It's been, married six years. Wow. And you said that situations got worse about six months ago? Mhmm. Post different six months ago. What's your so

0:06:13

Speaker #2

verbally abusive. And and when he I came in here because he held me up against the wall, and that was scary. Okay. Tell me about this feeling of fear that you felt scared. Tell me a little bit more about that. I felt like maybe he was going to hit me, but he didn't. And so that made me scared that he could possibly hurt me. Okay.

0:06:35

Speaker #1

I'm going to ask you a couple of questions as to how we're dealing with this specific situation. And, again, the best answer is an honest answer. Okay? So I want you to think really hard if any of these characteristics sound like something that's happened. Okay? Let's talk a little bit about emotional characteristics. Are you feeling anger? Are you feeling bitterness? Bitterness, I should say, guilt, sadness. How do we feel right now with this concern?

0:07:04

Speaker #2

I'm feeling definite sadness because I'm not happy in the relationship right now, but I was happy. And I love him, and I wanna make it work. So I kinda feel discouraged. Okay.

0:07:18

Speaker #1

What are the feelings of your name?

0:07:23

Speaker #2

I'll yarn for him to stop drinking.

0:07:27

Speaker #1

Well, something about that is the good thing is that you and I are here. Right? And that's something that we can work on on the things that you're experiencing with him. However, he's not here with us today. So it would be a little bit difficult to accomplish that type of book because he's not here with us. But the good thing is that you are here, and I can help you navigate this situation if you wish to do so. K? Tell me about anger, guilt. Any other feelings that you might be having because of this concern?

0:08:01

Speaker #2

Well, I feel inadequate. I feel like what is wrong with me that he would treat me like this. And I think he may be cheating on me, and that's why he's accusing me of doing it.

0:08:17

Speaker #1

What does feeling inadequate mean to?

0:08:21

Speaker #2

I don't feel good enough for him that he would have to look for it sometimes.

0:08:26

Speaker #1

Look for what?

0:08:27

Speaker #2

Whatever makes him happy.

0:08:32

Speaker #1

Let's talk about anything physical that relates to your current situation. So let's talk about, do you experience any headaches because of this situation, chest pains, you feel digestive problems, for example, having diarrhea or vomiting, any sort of physical characteristics that are coming with this issue. So it's affecting my sleep.

0:08:56

Speaker #2

I'm not eating as much. So I would say it's, affecting my appetite. I've been kind of excessively working out. I'm really that's how I cope, and I feel like it helps me. Plus, I feel like maybe I'm overweight, and I need to lose weight. And that might be what's, made in terms of someone else.

0:09:21

Speaker #1

Have you talked to a physician about excessively working out, or does that need to work more accessible?

0:09:27

Speaker #2

I do it, like, two times a day every day. Okay. And sometimes I just push myself way too hard to where I'm not feeling well because I'm not eating a lot also.

0:09:46

Speaker #1

Sadly, you need to any digestive problems? Yes. I already had IBS, but I think it's made it worse. Okay. We're also going to talk a little bit about your medical history too. So if you think there's anything there, that you would like to share with me, I would appreciate that too for sure. Tell me about any changes in your behavior because of this concern. So for example, you have become more isolated and withdrawn. You have lost interest in things that you like to do. What would you tell me?

0:10:17

Speaker #2

Yeah. All of that. I mean, I don't see my family as often as I used to. I don't go out with friends ever because he always accuses me of doing something if I go out with friends, and it usually leads to a body when I get home. I don't know. I I feel like I just used to be, like, a happier, more joyful. I I used to laugh and joke, and I feel like that's gone. K. It's harder for me to I'm just naturally more serious now.

0:10:53

Speaker #1

Do you think there's anything that we might have missed regards to this new change of adjusting with increase of as you explained it abuse from your husband. Anything that you're thinking about, this is important. I think I should mention that. Well, thank you for sharing that with me. I appreciate it. This is usually the hardest step is to come to the office for the first time and share how you feel. So I'll have you know that you are doing one of the hardest things, and it's it's nice for you to share that. I really appreciate it. It was hard for me because he hasn't had it on me. Okay. Well, like I said, I can't share your information with anybody unless that you pose a serious threat to yourself, another person, and we can't deescalate or the physical or sexual abuse of a minor or an elderly person, which here in our state would define as a person of sixty five sixty four, I should say, age. Tell me about any other concerns. So for example, depression, anxiety, having issues with grief, eating disorders, anything that you say, you know what? I I struggle with that, or this is really complicated for me. What would you tell me? I've always

0:12:07

Speaker #2

had anxiety, just generalized anxiety.

0:12:12

Speaker #3

Okay.

0:12:13

Speaker #2

I used to be on medication for that. Okay.

0:12:17

Speaker #1

When you say always, when did you receive a formal diagnosis for anxiety? Okay. However when I was in high school. Okay. What happened then that led to seeking that type of help for a diagnosis?

0:12:32

Speaker #2

Well, my, my life just wasn't good. Good. My mom and dad fought all the time. He had multiple affairs on my dad on my mom.

0:12:45

Speaker #1

Well, anxiety looks different from one person to the next. Right? So for example, some people may become, say, a little bit more isolated. Some people may start becoming restless. So help me understand what anxiety feels and looks like to you.

0:13:02

Speaker #2

It's kinda like I have a short fuse. I'm very air more irritable. Okay. We have a daughter, and I'm I'm definitely more impatient and short with the daughter.

0:13:15

Speaker #1

Tell me about any other characteristics. So for example, becoming confused, say, trying to avoid certain things, having difficulty breathing. Any other characteristics that you can share with me?

0:13:29

Speaker #2

I think I had an anxiety attack maybe two weeks ago. Okay. I just felt really overwhelmed. My heart started racing. I started breathing heavy. I felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest. Okay. And I kind of just lost it and cried for about fifteen minutes, and then I felt better. Okay. Is that oh, has that happened before? I don't remember. My last one was, like, in college, I think. Okay. What was different two weeks ago? I don't know. I think I became really overwhelmed with just his actions and his drinking. It was a day he had been at work, and he came home already drunk. And so I was like, I don't know if he's drinking at work or during the day while he's at work. He works So late, you know, most days, and then he came home later, and he was already drunk. So I don't know if he stopped at the bar after or what. But, he came in just, like, complaining about the house not being cleaned, complaining about the laundry not being done. And I work also, so I just haven't had time to do it. He complained about my cooking, so I just that's what I had to pay.

0:14:49

Speaker #1

What was different at college? You say that it hadn't happened since college.

0:14:54

Speaker #2

It was my senior year, and I was just, overwhelmed with, trying to find a job, a change, passing boards,

0:15:05

Speaker #1

all of that. Okay. Good. Yeah. We're actually going to talk a little bit about your education as well, so I'd like to hear more about your background for sure. Tell me how many times a day do you consider to to feel anxious? So does it happen multiple times a day? Does it happen daily? Maybe a couple times every week? Pretty rare. So I would say daily for sure. Daily. Okay. When do you usually do you have any triggers that you might have been identified before? When do you usually feel more anxiety? My triggers are, like,

0:15:38

Speaker #2

just noise. Like, if my kid's being too loud or too hyperactive and banging pots and pans, you know, just loud noise from the triggers.

0:15:49

Speaker #1

Okay. And then her just not listening. Okay. Okay. And you said you were how old when these attacks, as you describe them, happened?

0:16:04

Speaker #4

How old? I don't think that was maybe that old.

0:16:08

Speaker #1

Okay. You did say that you've been treated for generalized anxiety. What does treatment mean?

0:16:15

Speaker #2

I saw a doctor. They put me on the inside of the patient. Okay. Did you receive any therapy? No. So psychotropic. So medication geared towards

0:16:24

Speaker #1

psychological disorders. Okay. If I were to ask you to rate anxiety today, right, not because you're seeing me because I'm a sweetheart, but if I were to ask you in regards to how complicated or how severe do you consider anxiety to be for you? So for example, is it not so bad so and so or it does impact me a lot? Which one would you pick?

0:16:55

Speaker #2

I would say moderately. I think it's affecting my parenting. Like I said, I've been I haven't been the mom or whatever, because I've been short with my daughter and the impatient. Okay.

0:17:06

Speaker #1

So we talked about marriage. We talked about anxiety. Is there anything else that you think, you know what? This is something that I would like to discuss. K. And if something comes back to you, you can always let me know. K? Because I'm like, oh, man. I wish I could talk about that. Or if you're not ready for it yet, yes. That's okay. Alright? Because we can't talk about it. Yeah. Well, thank you for sharing that. Let's talk a little bit about your past history. I know that you mentioned earlier that you have received treatment for anxiety. Have you ever been to therapy for other concerns or received any sort of medication for anything else? Okay. Have you ever been to the hospital or a clinic because of any psychological concern in the past? Okay. Good deal. Whenever you are prescribed medication, do you usually comply with the treatment, or is it difficult for you to comply with treatment? Okay. Good deal. So you take the medication as prescribed? Yes. More or less at the time you're supposed to take it? Perfect. Alright. Have you ever assaulted anyone? No. Never. Okay. So no fights. Anything else? Okay. Good. And any issues, for example, when at school or younger or today, so for example, you have this storied property, you ran away, you had some sexual promiscuity, for example, having recent sex or truancy, anything like that whatsoever. No. If anything else, the good girl. And so we'll follow her perfectionist. Yeah. K. What does it mean to be the good girl?

0:18:53

Speaker #2

Everything. Kind of all those.

0:18:56

Speaker #1

K. So now we're going to talk a little bit about your medical history, and you're wondering why is it that I have to talk about the history if I'm here for some mental health concerns. Well, the reason is because anything physical is going to have an impact in our psychological and devotional state. So for instance, if you suffer from back pain, for example, maybe if you suffer from back pain, you don't want to come to therapy because it's really painful to you. So that could affect how you adhere to treatment, for example. Or for instance, if you have a deficiency, right, a vitamin d deficiency, which we know by research that it can impact depression. So notice that there's always something physical that we should look into when it comes to mental health. So having said that, I do see you wear glasses. Do they work well for you? Do you need something else in order to see correctly? What can you tell me?

0:19:53

Speaker #2

No. My glasses are great. Okay. I have a mild prescription. So Okay. Good deal. Good deal. So they work just fine.

0:20:01

Speaker #1

Okay. Good deal. Any issues, for example, with your teeth, with dental, infections, pain, anything like that?

0:20:12

Speaker #2

No. I my biggest issue has been my IVS.

0:20:16

Speaker #1

Okay. What can you tell me about IVS?

0:20:19

Speaker #2

I am constipated a lot. It's hard for me to do that.

0:20:25

Speaker #1

Have you currently see your treatment, medical treatment for that?

0:20:29

Speaker #2

I saw and I have acid reflux also. Okay. But it shows along with that. But, I saw a gastroenterologist, and they did an endoscopy.

0:20:44

Speaker #3

I did see that. So

0:20:48

Speaker #1

yeah. Okay. So how are you managing that? I just take tons. Okay. How's that going? I like sometimes that helps, but I just wish I could fix the overall problem of it. Okay. What is the overall problem?

0:21:05

Speaker #2

I'm having to take tons every day that doesn't get massive reflux no matter what I eat.

0:21:09

Speaker #1

Okay. So as you know, I'm not a medical provider, so I really can't give you any sort of medical advice in in regards to anything on that aspect. But my job is also to look out for your best interest. So if you consider that, you know, maybe I need to check out and talk to a physician about this then. If you think that's in your best interest, then that's something that you could address. Okay. Any sort of let's talk about surgical history, minor surgery, major surgery, anything like that. No. Getting your teeth pulled, anything whatsoever.

0:21:48

Speaker #2

Yeah. I got my wisdom teeth cut out when I was seventeen.

0:21:52

Speaker #1

Okay. Can you tell me about that surgery?

0:21:57

Speaker #2

I don't remember a lot of it. I mean, it went well. It went well? Okay. Good deal.

0:22:02

Speaker #1

Good deal. Any history of, for example, an accident, hitting your head, losing consciousness, anything whatsoever? Okay. Okay. This one? Any history of smoke? Yeah. Okay. Any other diagnoses that you think other than IBS and anything else whatsoever. What would you tell me? So the bill without other than Okay. Good. Yeah. Let's talk a little bit about your social history. So now we're going to look into your background, and we're going to start from the very beginning. Where were you born? I was born in Michigan. In Michigan. So what brings you down here? A job. A job. How does that transition?

0:23:00

Speaker #2

It's okay. I'm closer to, so that's nice. Okay. So who's down here? My mom lived down here.

0:23:07

Speaker #3

Okay.

0:23:10

Speaker #1

How's that going?

0:23:12

Speaker #2

It's great. I mean, I miss her. Like I said, I don't get to sleep much anymore. So it was nice at first, but now I feel like she's so

0:23:22

Speaker #1

If I were to ask you who raised you, what would you tell me? I know. Just mom? What was that?

0:23:32

Speaker #2

I mean, he was there, but he they fought all the time. I mean, he didn't have much to his last kids. So K.

0:23:40

Speaker #1

Right. When you say they fart all the time, what does that mean?

0:23:45

Speaker #2

They would just strain, and he would leave. He'd be gone for a week or two, and then come back.

0:23:52

Speaker #1

Tell me a little bit more about your siblings. Right? Are you the oldest, the youngest? What would you tell me? I'm the youngest. I don't know how many. Two. Two. Okay. So I'm going to give you a couple of terms, and I want you to pick one that best describes your chocolate. K? So the first one is never abused. The second one is supportive and intact. The third one is dysfunctional. The fourth one is chaotic. The fifth one is prolonged separation, and the last one is abusive. Which one would you pick to describe your child? Chaotic. Okay. What makes it chaotic? Defiding.

0:24:36

Speaker #2

Constantly back and forth with my dad being the whole mother being gone. But my mom was very loving in her trip, so I feel like she tried to overcompensate

0:24:48

Speaker #3

her dad.

0:24:51

Speaker #1

What does it mean that she's trying to overcompensate for that?

0:24:55

Speaker #2

I think she kinda let us smile too much. Like, she was kinda trying to be kind and trying to be But she's all she's also that invited her since then.

0:25:04

Speaker #1

Okay. What's the meaning she got there?

0:25:09

Speaker #2

She's happier, and she, tries to get a smart, like, sound advice and, like, be more of a parent than a friend.

0:25:21

Speaker #1

Is that enough? Where is that? I don't know. Will you say that dad left?

0:25:40

Speaker #3

And you'll keep in touch with her?

0:25:43

Speaker #1

Okay. Who do you live with currently? Husband. Okay. Just one daughter? Mhmm. And then mentioned that there were some concerns with parenting, and you mentioned some concerns with family conflicts. Right? And some abuse as you describe it. Okay. Any other stressors in your family right now that you think this is affecting my family?

0:26:15

Speaker #2

I would say I mean, I don't have evidence of him cheating on me, but I think that he is. K.

0:26:23

Speaker #1

You did mention that you have had issues sleeping. Mhmm. When did that start? I'd

0:26:29

Speaker #2

say maybe a month ago. Okay.

0:26:33

Speaker #1

What changed the month ago?

0:26:35

Speaker #2

Him drinking more and being more verbally.

0:26:41

Speaker #1

Any issues with, say, for example, separation or divorce, anything that you think could be present? So let's talk a little bit about your education. Right? So you did mention that you attended college. Right? Did you graduate college? I did. K. What's your degree?

0:27:03

Speaker #2

Bachelor of science in nursing. Nursing.

0:27:06

Speaker #1

Beside your current. Right? Rate? Okay. It belongs to not talk about work. So you can tell me all about the coworkers you don't like it. So we can talk about that for sure. Okay. Alright. How satisfied were you in school, both grade school and college? What would you tell me? That was fine. Okay. Any issues in schools? For example, getting into fights or time out,

0:27:31

Speaker #2

grades, anything whatsoever. So Oh, it's been good, and I've always had the grades. Yeah. I didn't hear you.

0:27:38

Speaker #1

Okay. Good deal. I I do hear, this common theme about being good. Right? For example, you mentioned earlier, trying to be good and somewhat of a perfectionist, and I see that again with your with your schooling. So that's a common theme that I've seen so far. Did you need any sort of, say, for example, accommodations in school? If I were to ask you what would stop you from coming to therapy and actually doing sessions with me, what would that be? Anything cultural, religious, motivation, physical, anything that you think this would stop me from seeing her? What do you think? If he found out, I'm thinking about somebody more. Okay. How do you think he would find out?

0:28:30

Speaker #2

I don't know. Maybe if he saw, like, an insurance statement or something. Something. K. Yeah. Well, the thing about that is whenever we process our billing,

0:28:38

Speaker #1

we have an office manager know that to not mail anything directly to the bill That would be the option. Address or make a note to make sure that it looks confidential. But is it wrong when I'm keeping this from it? Well, the thing about right or wrong, I like to think about what is in your best interest. Right? So if you consider that this is the best thing that you can do for yourself right now, that is a very personal decision. And I usually like to go with, okay. What is something that I need to reach my goals?

0:29:10

Speaker #2

I just feel like it's a lie and, like, I'm too big. Like, it's not a lie in terms of my husband's, and I don't want my marriage more. But I do think the counseling's supposed to be.

0:29:22

Speaker #1

Well, like I said, unfortunately, he's not here, right, to address that situation. If later on, for example, if you think that's something you would like to include later, say, for example, in a couple session or something along those lines, if later on in the future and if you're ready and I think it's beneficial for your treatment, then, of course, we can modify a treatment plan. That's what you wish to do. Okay. And you did say you have a child. Have you had any other children? No. What about stepchildren? Okay. I had a miscarriage. Okay. Tell me what happened.

0:30:02

Speaker #2

I was five weeks pregnant, and I, just started bleeding heavily a lot, major cramping. So it passed naturally, so I didn't have to have a disease.

0:30:21

Speaker #1

You did say that you work out. Right? You did say that you work out to cope. What else do you do to cope? Say, for example, with the concerns at home or anxiety. Say, for instance, you listen to music, you play with your pets, you write, you play video games, anything that you do to cope.

0:30:42

Speaker #2

I like to take long showers, and that's that's Okay.

0:30:46

Speaker #1

And then with my daughter. Okay. What about anything else that doesn't involve another person? So for example, not your daughter. I don't. Okay. Well, something you're going to learn here is that many of our coping mechanisms don't involve another person. And the reason for that is because if the other person is not available, then what are we to do? Right? So a lot of the things that you're going to learn here, that's something you're interested in is probing mechanisms, right, and how to exploit them. Tell me about something that you say, you know what? I have that going on for me. So for example, academically, behavior, communication, your family, say, for any other things that you think, you know what? I have that going for me.

0:31:39

Speaker #2

Academically. Okay. I like my job. I work two days a week Okay. Right now until last time I get to be with my my daughter. Okay.

0:31:52

Speaker #1

For example, let's take about motivation. Are you motivated to come to therapy, or you think this is not going to work out for you in other sessions?

0:32:02

Speaker #2

I'm just nervous they don't put out. Okay.

0:32:05

Speaker #1

But, otherwise, I'm motivated. Okay. Any support in your community? So, for example, any clubs, any societies, church, anything like that? Okay. Let's talk a little bit about your criminal history. So for example, have you been arrested, incarcerated, jail, prison, anything like that? And as a juvenile. Okay. Do you identify with any sort of religion or spiritual belief?
