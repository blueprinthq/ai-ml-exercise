Subjective
Session conducted in-person. Patient reports feeling down and unmotivated for several months, with significant worsening over the past few months. She expresses a desire to feel better but feels stuck, stating, "I just can't really be bothered to do anything at all." Patient feels isolated, believing there is no one to talk to about her feelings, and does not want to burden her friends or family. She reports experiencing academic pressure and feelings of unworthiness and frustration, which contribute to her depressive symptoms.

Objective
Therapist employed several interventions during the session, including reflective listening to help patient articulate her feelings and stressors. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques were used to identify negative thoughts, such as feelings of unworthiness and the belief that her efforts are pointless. Therapist also explored patient's emotions and physical reactions to these thoughts, connecting them to her depressive symptoms. Additionally, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) strategies were utilized to encourage patient to accept her emotions and clarify her values regarding success. Therapist's approach aimed to foster a safe environment for patient to explore her feelings and consider coping strategies. Progress towards treatment objectives was minimal, as patient has not yet identified or implemented specific coping strategies, nor has she reported a decrease in stress levels.

Assessment
Patient presents with symptoms consistent with Major Depressive Disorder, including persistent low mood, lack of motivation, social isolation, negative self-perception, and sleep disturbances. There is no reported risk of self-harm or harm to others, but patient expresses feelings of frustration and sadness. The ongoing nature of these symptoms indicates a continued need for therapeutic intervention to address her mental health concerns.

Plan
Patient is encouraged to keep a thought diary to track negative thoughts and associated feelings throughout the week. She is also asked to identify one small activity she enjoys and commit to doing it before the next session. The next session will focus on cognitive restructuring techniques to challenge negative thoughts and explore patient's values further, with mindfulness exercises planned to help manage overwhelming emotions.
